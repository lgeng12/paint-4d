# PAINT 4D

Our project is a collaborative AR paint experience. With the power of Three.js, we created a space for people to draw together by waving their phones at a webcam. Computer vision on our website tracks special codes on the phone to capture the 3D location of your hand. We hosted the service using Oracle Cloud and added functionality to save and restore drawings with Firebase. We hope that people use our space to relax, show off their creativity, and have fun with a low-cost yet futuristic AR application.
